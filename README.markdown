What is Broker_Pet?
===================

Broker_Pet is a simple LDB pet display that was requested over on the WoWInterface forums in this [thread][].

There are two different displays of pet XP:

  1. A normal xxx/yyy type display
  2. A pseudo-XP bar made up of the "|" character.
  
See the screenshots for an example and click the feed to switch between them.
